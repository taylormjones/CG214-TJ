I discovered these beautiful and aesthetic experiments. One that crossed me was the "Visual Art Sessions.

<p>Virtual Art Sessions were created by the Google Data Arts Team.  In the process of the experiment they used a "Tilt Brush" which is used to create life size 3D brush strokes of different elements like a painting. 
     
The project partnered with 6 world renowned artists bringing them a new way to paint, draw and sculpt. We recorded their sessions and made it accessible online, letting anyone observe the artists as they develop their VR creations from any angle.
